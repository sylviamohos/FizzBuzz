# FizzBuzz
Demonstrate how to use loops and conditionals to output desired results.

This is a tried and true coding problem where we are asked to action the following:
* Mark all numbers from 1 - 100 that are multiples of 3 as "Fizz"
* Mark all numbers from 1 - 100 that are multiples of 5 as "Buzz"
* Mark all numbers from 1 - 100 that are multiples of both 3 and 5, mark as "FizzBuzz"

Happy coding!
